### Journal App W | Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, MongoDB, Redis Cloud, Docker, REST APIs, JUnit, Mockito

– **Engineered a backend application implementing role-based authorization, preventing unauthorized access.
– **Integrated JWT-based authentication mechanisms to enhance session security and reduce token misuse risks.
– **Designed 12+ RESTful CRUD endpoints using a layered architecture to support distinct User and Admin roles with fully enforced access control.

– **Improved application performance by combining MongoDB persistence with Redis caching, reducing database response time by 60%.

– **Automated email notification workflows using SMTP and cron jobs, ensuring 100% on-time alerts.
– **Containerized the application using Docker and deployed on Render, enabling scalability and high availability.


# Spring Boot Repository

This repository contains projects built using **Spring Boot**. Currently, it hosts a single project:

## 📌 Journal App
The **Journal App** is a web-based application developed using **Spring Boot**. It allows users to create, manage, and organize journal entries efficiently.

### 🔥 Features Implemented:

- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage using **MySQL/PostgreSQL**.
- **RESTful API**: Well-structured API endpoints for journal management.
- **Spring Security**: Ensures user data protection.
- **Deployment Ready**: Configured for cloud deployment.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Spring Boot** (Core framework)
- **Spring Security** (Authentication & Authorization)
- **Spring Data JPA** (Database access)
- **MongoDB** (Database)
- **Thymeleaf/REST API** (Frontend rendering & integration)
- **Maven** (Dependency management)

### 🚀 Setup & Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd spring-boot/journal-app
   ```
3. Configure database settings in `application.properties`.
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### 📌 Future Enhancements:
